            <p id="s42">This is an ongoing log of feedback, thoughts, correspondences and general notes summarized by Shravani Bagawde from Fall 2023 to Spring 2024 (TK). If all is going as according to Shravani's plan, this website should be updated every week. ✼</p>

			<p class="writing">Post Final Fall Review:</p>
			<p class="writing">(  1  ) Interrogating 'how' as opposed to 'who' or 'what'... (goes back to John Durham Peter's media triad)</p>
			<p class="writing">(  2  ) Building from the contextless void... (what do these pieces look like in the real world, how do their interactions manifest in real life?)</p>
			<p class="writing">(  3  ) Documentation over time... (how do pages gradually evolve and shift and move and how can you show that?)</p>

			<div class="date">12/06/2023</div>
			<p class="writing">Thinking and making in terms of text: Notebooks and notebooks and pages and receipts and files with multitudes of strings. Tells: (  1  ) The most graphical project I have made (Hypertext Rangoli) still uses the unicode character as its base material</p>

			<p class="writing">From the get-go, my biggest conflict has been deliberating whether the topic(s) I want to research through my thesis even warrant “design interventions”. In other words, everything that I could imagine working on feels like it should just be an essay or a paper or something just written out. I think this year has been a bit of a break-through in realizing that maybe I have always been a writer first and a designer second <span class="grey">(Although I am extremely hesitant to assign myself either of those titles in any sort of credible capacity).</span></p> 
			<p>But considering I am graduating with a degree in design and that the act of making does still bring me some joy, I hope to funnel this feeling into something a bit less hindering. I could center the act of writing, the act of researching in my process. Instead of it being an initial step, could it be the primary focus? <span class="grey">(Reminds me of something Kath Burton, from the CFTH interviews said: “…a digital archive that documents the different outputs along a research process”)</span> In this way, design becomes less so an *intervention*  and more-so an interpretation? It becomes a way of understanding as opposed to a container?</p>

			<p>Some thing I have to keep telling myself is that making itself is a kind of research. Even outside the more typical formal explorations and experiments that approach allows, making itself is conducive to other kinds of research.</p>

			<p class="writing">From Allen Hori:</p>
			<p class="writing">(  1  ) "The more specificity you develop, the closer you are to a universal perspective"</p>
			<p class="writing">(  2  ) “You have a steady thread of poetics throughout your works, keep that as a consistent through-line (don’t be too literal, it feels jarring!)”</p>
			<p>(  3  ) “Modalities read as headlines”</p>
		</div>
		<div class="entry">
			<div class="date">11/03/2023</div>
			<p class="writing">MOVE FORWARD; ASSERT</p>
			<p class="writing">(  1  ) From Haylee: What is my role? (critic, educator, spectator, commentator, etc.) Consider <a href="https://whitney.org/media/39382">Christine Sun Kim</a></p>
			<p>(  2  ) “Invite the interaction; the the audience do the labor they need to”</p>
			<p class="writing">(  3  ) From Andrew: “Couching what you are doing through specific choices (narrow your decisions down)”</p>
			<p>(  4  ) “Subheadings/Modalities as guiding/entry points ”</p>

			<div class="date">10/27/2023</div>
			<p class="writing">Small group feedback:</p>
			<p class="writing">(  1  ) Presenting an indication of the default being subverted in some way (like the blur in Doubting); Think: <a href="https://www.librarystack.org/times-dot/">Laurel Schwulst’s Times Dot</a>; Manifesting that indication through the type itself, the layout (CONSIDER THE FORM!!); Going off of subtraction being an additive process (a flickering, a blinking)</p>
			<p>(  2  ) From Andrew: "Try switching the order of drafting, writing, editing and designing" (Using a pre-determined format and then finding content to match it)</p>
			<p class="writing">(  3  ) On Pamphlets & Margins:  Make the border as large and attention-seeking as possible (encroachment, erosion); Add more media (can the multimedia component of the pamphlets can be embeded into the peripheries themselves)</p>
			<p ><span class="grey">PANIC!: Maybe I’m just more interested in modes of distribution; disaster media and information dispersion in crisis</span></p>

			<div class="date">10/22/2023</div>
			<p class="writing">Gleaning from <a href="https://bendenzer.com/">Ben Denzer's</a> Lecture: How can accrual develop meaning (both time-wise and scale-wise)</p>
			<p class="writing">From Andrew: Potentially incorporating a workshop/syllabus-based demo within the thesis; A way to show teaching development within your thesis</p>
			<p class="writing">Small group feedback:</p>
			<p class="writing">(  1  ) Very effective to show people’s interpretations of doubts/defaults </p>
			<p class="writing">(  2  ) Consider the hierarchy of presentation (what are you showing first? how can you ease people into this topic?)</p>
			<p class="writing">(  3  ) Perhaps establishing a similar frame work as with SMS research (1. Definitional and historical framework; 2. Getting into one side of the relationship; 4. Getting into the other side of the relationship; 5. Exploring the integrated relationship) </p>

			<p class="writing">Re: The network as a format, a container, etc. etc.</p>
			<p class="writing">Potentially, the works could embody different lenses and perspectives through which to explore the relationship between doubts or defaults (or scarily, something else that may arise as a better topic of focus).</p>
			<p class="writing">Exploring temporality…releasing information over time</p>
			<p class="writing">Exploring flexibility…working with adaptable mediums</p>
			<p class="writing">Exploring sites…creating a work that goes to its viewers</p>
			<p class="writing">Also: the visual language — is the sans-serif yellow-on-black/blue-on-white worth continued exploration?</p>		
			<p class="writing">Also: Visually, am I conveying the relationship between doubts and defaults through form? Is that the content and then is dispersion the form? Hm. </p>
